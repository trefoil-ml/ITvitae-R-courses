## Tidy Data

**NOTES**

- Add [Tidy Data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) to reading
- Use COW war dataset as an example of non-tidy data
- Also WDI data for non-tidy data
- Replication datatsets are often non-tidy. Why?
- See this post by [Jeff Leek](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)

The Rules

1. Each **variable** has its own **column**
2. Each **observation** muust have its own **row**
3. Each **value** must have its own **cell**

or even

1. Put each **dataset** in a **tibble**
2. Put each **variable** in a **column**

These seem obvious at first, so we need to see examples of not-following tidy data and what happens.

Some nuances:

The definitions of **variable**, **observation**, and **value** are not always clear. And how you store and arrange the data can depend on how you aim to use it. Generally, aim for storing the data in a tidy format that ensures minimal errors. When you model it, you can transform the data later.
See non-tidy data.

It is easier to work with variables in columns because of `mutate` and `summary` functions.
It will also work better with `tidyverse` functions: e.g. using `group_by` to group and summarize, or `facet_*` and aesthetics in **ggplot2**.

The tidy data ideas are adapted from the [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization), but simplified and adapted to the general uses of practicing data scientists.


### Exercises

1. Describe how the variables and observations are organised in each of the sample tables.

In `table1` each row is a (country, year) with variables `cases` and `population`.
```{r}
table1
```

In `table2`, each row is country, year , variable ("cases", "population") combination, and there is a `count` variable with the numeric value of the variable.
```{r}
table2
```

In `table3`, each row is a (country, year) combination with the column `rate` having the rate of cases to population as a character string in the format `"cases/rate"`.
```{r}
table3
```

Table 4 is split into two tables, one table for each variable: `table4a` is the table for cases, while `table4b` is the table for population. Within each table, each row is a country, each column is a year, and the cells are the value of the variable for the table.
```{r}
table4a
```
```{r}
table4b
```

2. Compute the `rate` for `table2`, and `table4a` + `table4b`. You will need to perform four operations:

  1. Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
  2. Extract the matching population per country per year.
  3. Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
  4. Store back in the appropriate place.
  
Which representation is easiest to work with? Which is hardest? Why?

Without using the joins covered in Ch 12:
```{r}
tb2_cases <- filter(table2, type == "cases")[["count"]]
tb2_country <- filter(table2, type == "cases")[["country"]]
tb2_year <- filter(table2, type == "cases")[["year"]]
tb2_population <- filter(table2, type == "population")[["count"]]
table2_clean <- tibble(country = tb2_country,
       year = tb2_year,
       rate = tb2_cases / tb2_population)
table2_clean
```
Note, that this assumes that all observations are sorted so that each country, year will have the observation for cases followed by population.

```{r}
tibble(country = table4a[["country"]],
       `1999` = table4a[["1999"]] / table4b[["1999"]],
       `2000` = table4b[["2000"]] / table4b[["2000"]])
```
or 
```{r}
tibble(country = rep(table4a[["country"]], 2),
       year = rep(c(1999, 2000), each = nrow(table4a)),
       `rate` = c(table4a[["1999"]] / table4b[["1999"]],
                  table4b[["2000"]] / table4b[["2000"]]))
```


3. Recreate the plot showing change in cases over time using `table2` instead of `table1`. What do you need to do first?

First, I needed to filter the tibble to only include those rows that represented the "cases" variable.
```{r}
table2 %>% 
  filter(type == "cases") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, count)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```


## Spreading and Gathering

```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```

```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```


### Exercises

1. Why are gather() and spread() not perfectly symmetrical?
   Carefully consider the following example:


```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```

The functions `spread` and `gather` are not perfectly symmetrical because column type information is not transferred between them. 
In the original table the column `year` was numeric, but after the spread-gather cyle it is character, because with `gather`, variable names are always converted to a character vector.

The `convert` argument tries to convert character vectors to the appropriate type. 
In the background this uses the `type.convert` function.
```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`, convert = TRUE)
```

2. Why does this code fail?

```{r error=TRUE}
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

The code fails because the column names `1999` and `2000` are not standard and thus needs to be quoted.
The tidyverse functions will interpret `1999` and `2000` without quotes as looking for the 1999th and 2000th column of the data frame.
This will work:
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

3. Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?


```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)
glimpse(people)
```

```{r error=TRUE}
spread(people, key, value)
```

Spreading the data frame fails because there are two rows with "age" for "Phillip Woods".
We would need to add another column with an indicator for the number observation it is,

```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value, ~obs,
  #-----------------|--------|------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45, 1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186, 1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50, 2,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37, 1,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156, 1
)
spread(people, key, value)
```


4. Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
```

You need to gather it. The variables are:

- pregnant: logical ("yes", "no")
- female: logical
- count: integer

```{r}
gather(preg, sex, count, male, female) %>%
  mutate(pregnant = pregnant == "yes",
         female = sex == "female") %>%
  select(-sex)
```
Converting `pregnant` and `female` from character vectors to logical was not necessary to tidy it, but it makes it easier to work with.

## Separating and Uniting

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>%
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
```

```{r}
table5 %>%
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```


### Exercises

1. What do the extra and fill arguments do in separate()? Experiment with the various 
options for the following two toy datasets.

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

```{r}
?separate
```

The `extra` argument tells `separate` what to do if there are too many pieces,
and the `fill` argument if there aren't enough.

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```
By default `separate` drops the extra values with a warning.
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "drop")
```
This produces the same result as above, dropping extra values, but without the warning.
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")
```
In this, the extra values are not split, so "f,g" appears in column three.

In this, one of the entries for column, "d,e", has too few elements.
The default for `fill` is similar to `separate`; it fills with missing values but emits a warning. In this, row 2 of column "three", is `NA`.
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

Alternative options for `fill` are `"right"`, to fill with missing values from the right, but without a warning
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = "right")
```
The option `fill = "left"` also fills with missing values without a warning, but this time from the left side.
Now, column "one" of row 2 will be missing, and the other values in that row are shifted over.
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = "left")
```

2. Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a remove argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to `FALSE`?

You would set it to `FALSE` if you want to create a new variable, but keep the old one.

3. Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`, Why are there three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with groups), but only one unite?

The function `extract` uses a regular expression to find groups and split into columns.
In `unite` it is unambigous since it is many columns to one, and once the columns are specified, there is only one way to do it, the only choice is the `sep`.
In `separate`, it is one to many, and there are multiple ways to split the character string.


## Missing Values


### Exercises


1. Compare and contrast the `fill` arguments to `spread()` and `complete()`.

```{r}
?spread
```
```{r}
?complete
```

In `spread`, the fill argument explicitly sets the value to replace `NA`s.
In `complete`, the fill argument also sets a value to replace `NA`s but it is named list, allowing for different values for different variables.
Also, both cases replace both implicit and explicit missing values.

2. What does the direction argument to `fill()` do?

With `fill`, it determines whether `NA` values should be replaced by the previous non-missing value (`"down"`) or the next non-missing value (`"up"`).



## Case Study


```{r}
who1 <- who %>%
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
glimpse(who1)
```

```{r}
who2 <- who1 %>%
 mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))

```

```{r}
who3 <- who2 %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3
```

```{r}
who3 %>%
  count(new)
```

```{r}
who4 <- who3 %>%
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)
```

```{r}
who5 <- who4 %>%
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who5
```


### Exercises

1. In this case study I set `na.rm = TRUE` just to make it easier to check that we had the correct values. Is this reasonable? Think about how missing values are represented in this dataset. Are there implicit missing values? What’s the difference between an `NA` and zero?

Perhaps? I would need to know more about the data generation process. 
There are zero's in the data, which means they may explicitly be indicating no cases.
```{r}
who1 %>%
  filter(cases == 0) %>%
  nrow()
```

So it appears that either a country has all its values in a year as non-missing if the WHO collected data for that country, or all its values are non-missing. 
So it is okay to treat explicitly and implicitly missing values the same, and we don't lose any information by dropping them.
```{r}
gather(who, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases") %>%
  group_by(country, year)  %>%
  mutate(missing = is.na(cases)) %>%
  select(country, year, missing) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

```



2. What happens if you neglect the `mutate()` step? (`mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")`)

`separate` emits the warning "too few values", and if we check the 
rows for keys beginning with `"newrel_"`, we see that `sexage` is messing, 
and `type = m014`.

```{r}
who3a <- who1 %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")

filter(who3a, new == "newrel") %>% head()
```


3. I claimed that `iso2` and `iso3` were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.

```{r}
select(who3, country, iso2, iso3) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

```


4. For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualisation of the data.

```{r}
who5 %>%
  group_by(country, year, sex) %>%
  filter(year > 1995) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  unite(country_sex, country, sex, remove = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, group = country_sex, colour = sex)) +
  geom_line()

  
```

A small multiples plot faceting by country is difficult given the number of countries.
Focusing on those countries with the largest changes or absolute magnitudes after providing the context above is another option.
